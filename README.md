# lethal-company-agent-modpack

A modpack created for the Agents.

This modpack is meant to be a Vanilla+ experience, targeted toward non-serious 4+ player multiplayer games. It includes many of the most popular mods with a focus on adding new Scrap, Monsters selective shop items which don't feel too overpowered. There are also a lot of QoL mods to make the game more enjoyable (but also easier in some cases).

This pack was based off [Vanillaish_Heavy_v55_v56_Modpack](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Caketaco/Vanillaish_Heavy_v55_v56_Modpack/), then updated for V69
