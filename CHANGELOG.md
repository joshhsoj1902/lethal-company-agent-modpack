# Changelog

## 0.7.0

Made various improvements to the modpack after playing with it for 4+ hours.

### BREAKING CHANGES

Removed `Dio93-DuckMod` mod. The Ducks were super buggy often not rendering their models while still picking up scrap. We found them to be more annoying then. All players will need to remove the mod (I don't think I can force that via a modpack update).

### Additions

`AMRV-LethalCompanyVariables` was added to simplify balancing scrap values. I don't love this mod but it's the best option I could find.

### Other Changes

- Better balance the sell value of outdoor easy to kill monsters.
- Disable monsters being able to move inside/outside. The AI didn't seem to work for everything.

## 0.6.0

Added the github actions config to automate building & publishing releases.

Otherwise this should be a no-op change for modpack users.

## 0.5.2

Add config section to the readme.
Enable all toomanyemotes emotes by default.

## 0.5.1

Make readme good.

## 0.5.0

Removed the following mods:
    - "Flof-MemeSoundboard-1.1.2"
    - "Enchanted_Games-MoreSoundboardSounds-1.3.0",
Dropping the ingame soundboard resulted in +100 weight, the code is private so I can't easily fix it.
